    <h1 >GIVE IT UP ONCE MORE FOR PAXI...</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Born on March 20th 2014, Cotopaxi(Paxi for short) Juhala has lived up to his name. He is anything but normal. He vomitted on my brother on our first ride home, he made me chase him up and down the neighborhood barefoot, and he is the most cat-like dog I have ever met. Regardless of all his unique quirks he is perfect in my eyes and I wouldn't trade him for any other dog. That being said, I want to dedicate this site to Paxi to celebrate his existence!</p>
