    <h1>Paxi Supremacy! </h1>
    <h2>All about him!</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_Terrier">Paxi</a> was born on March 17th 2013. He puked on Xavi on the drive home from picking him up. He's a little <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/funky">funky</a> and stinky but we love him regardless. I used to lowkey be scared of him when he was a puppy because he was kind of ugly. He farts a lot when he gets nervous(which is a lot). My mom takes him on her walk every day and she makes Paxi walk like ten miles every day...tragic.
    He's now almost 8 years old! I can't believe it.</p>
